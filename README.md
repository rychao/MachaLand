## CSE 165 - Final Project

### Implementing an OpenGL game using the SOIL library


Our team will be recreating the first game of the popular show called Squid Game, where the user has to cross a finish line in a specific amount of time. However, the enemy has a built-in object detection and if it detects you moving in its line of sight you lose.
